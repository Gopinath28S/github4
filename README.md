From Farm to Fork: Blockchain-Powered Organic Food Traceability
📌 Overview

The rising demand for organic food has made authenticity, transparency, and traceability critical in supply chains. Traditional certification systems often fail to ensure consumer trust due to fraud and mislabeling.

This project leverages Blockchain, IoT (QR codes), and Smart Contracts to build a decentralized, tamper-proof, and transparent organic food traceability system. Consumers can scan QR codes to verify product origin, while farmers are incentivized with token-based rewards for sustainable farming practices.
📱 Key Modules
👨‍🌾 Farmer Portal

Generate QR codes for products.

Track token rewards.

Manage farming activity & statistics.

🛒 Consumer Portal

Scan QR codes on products.

Verify product origin, certifications, and farmer details.

Rate farmers and reward them with tokens.

🏬 Store

Redeem earned tokens for farming tools and equipment.
Workflow

Farmer registers product → QR code generated → stored on blockchain.

Consumer scans QR → retrieves immutable product history.

Smart contracts verify data → tokens awarded to farmers.

Tokens redeemed → for tools/services in the ecosystem.
